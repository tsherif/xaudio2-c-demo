XAudio2 in C Demo
=================

A small example of using the Windows XAudio2 API in C.

The code is all in a single file, `xaudio2-c-demo.c`, which is heavily commented.

To build, run `build.bat` from a shell with [cl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-160) set up (or build in your favorite IDE with the audio file `sound.wav`).
